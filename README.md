# -Advanced-ATM-Simulation-in-Python
his is a console-based ATM simulation project developed using Python. The project mimics the core functionalities of an ATM system such as PIN verification, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, mini statements, and limited login attempts with a user-friendly interface.

Features
🔐 PIN Verification with limited attempts (lockout after 3 incorrect tries)
💰 Balance Check – View your current account balance
🏦 Cash Deposit – Add money to your account
💸 Cash Withdrawal – Withdraw money if balance is sufficient
📜 Transaction History – Mini statement of recent transactions
⏹️ Exit Option – Securely exit the simulation

💡 Technologies Used
-Python 3
-Core concepts: if-else, while loops, functions, lists, input/output.

🧑‍💻 Ideal For
Beginners learning Python and logic-building
Practicing real-life simulations using conditionals and loops
Building terminal-based applications
